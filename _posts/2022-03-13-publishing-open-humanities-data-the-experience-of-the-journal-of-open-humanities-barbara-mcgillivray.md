The Journal of Open Humanities Data (JOHD), was launched in 2015 with the aim of promoting values of data sharing and reuse in the vast field of Humanities. In this talk, I will share my experience from developing the journal into an important player in the open research and data-sharing community and will discuss the opportunities and challenges faced along this process.[April 13, 2022 1500-1600 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2022&month=4&day=13&hour=15&min=0&sec=0&p1=137&p2=75&p3=179&p4=136&p5=195&p6=53&p7=771&p8=196&p9=240&p10=264)

The Journal of Open Humanities  Data (JOHD), was launched in 2015 with the aim of promoting values of  data sharing and reuse in the vast field of Humanities. JOHD publishes  data-focused articles and aims to play a key role in growing a community  of Humanities researchers sharing data. Over the past two years, JOHD  has expanded significantly. It has published an increasing number of  articles and launched new themed special collections of articles. Its  role in the open data community among academics and professionals of the  cultural heritage sector has been strengthened thanks to an increased  social media presence and activity and to a number of talks, events, and  participation in expert panels. Its team has also expanded, leading to a  more diverse intellectual contribution. In this talk, I will share my  experience from developing the journal into an important player in the  open research and data-sharing community and will discuss the  opportunities and challenges faced along this process.
