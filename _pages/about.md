<p>Humanities Data Inquiry is a community of practice and network of projects and laboratories dedicated to understanding the role of data in traditional humanities research and publication workflows.</p>

<p>A premise of the project is that Humanities researchers understands and uses what other disciplines call data in (at times) fundamentally different ways from that found in those other disciplines: it is (often) produced through argument rather than experimentation and, as Christine Borgman argues, the definition of data is often a valuable act of Humanities research in its own right.</p>
